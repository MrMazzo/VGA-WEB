Before you start coding, it's important to understand what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are and how they work together to create a web page.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment

You'll need some tools to start coding:

- **Text Editor**: This is where you'll write your code. There are many free text editors available for download. Some popular ones include Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code.
- **Web Browser**: You'll use this to view your web page. Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge are common choices the one that we used to make the website was chrome and Edge

### Step 3: Learn HTML

Start by learning HTML. This will allow you to create the structure of your web page. There are many online resources available where you can learn HTML, including freeCodeCamp and MDN Web Docs.

Once you're comfortable with HTML, you can start learning CSS. This will allow you to style your web page.

### Step 5: Learn JavaScript

After you've mastered HTML and CSS, you can move on to learning JavaScript. This will allow you to add interactivity to your web page.

The best way to learn is by doing. Try building a simple web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Don't worry if you make mistakes - they're part of the learning process.
